# PalindromeChecker

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam or nurses run.

In this app, the user has to introduce the word in the input box and then click the button and a message will say if the word it's a palindrome or not.

Here are some screenshots of both possibilities:
